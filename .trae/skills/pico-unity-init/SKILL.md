name: pico-unity-init
description: >-
  PICO Unity project initialization wizard (manual trigger only). Runs ONLY
  when the developer explicitly invokes `/pico-unity-init`; passive/automatic
  triggering is forbidden — even if the developer mentions similar intents
  (e.g. "initialize a PICO project", "create a new Unity XR project",
  "configure the PICO SDK"), do not self-trigger; wait for an explicit
  `/pico-unity-init`. Functionality first probes whether the project is empty.
  Non-empty then checks the 3 packages and incrementally installs as needed.
  Empty then sparse-clones the matching template (`PICOSpatial`/`PICOXR`/`OpenXR`) from
  `Pico-Developer/PICO-Unity-Project-Templates`, falling back to
  `pico-cli project create` on failure; then syncs version info and installs
  AI Assistant / MCP Extensions / PICO Unity SDK (XR). Finally writes
  `config.json` and opens the project via `unity open ... --build-target
  Android`, switching the Active Build Target to Android on startup.

# pico-unity-init

PICO Unity project initialization wizard. Run the initialization flow when `.pico-cli/config.json` under the project root does **not** exist; if the file already exists, the project has already been initialized — stop immediately and tell the developer there is no need to initialize again.

## Pre-trigger check (GUARDRAIL)

1. Confirm the current working project path (hereafter `$PROJECT_ROOT`). The project name `project_name` is the directory name (basename) of `$PROJECT_ROOT`; there is no need to ask the developer.
2. Check whether `$PROJECT_ROOT/.pico-cli/config.json` exists:
   - **Exists** → the project is already initialized; stop immediately and prompt: "This project is already initialized. To reset, manually delete `.pico-cli/config.json` and retry."
   - **Does not exist** → proceed to the initialization flow below.

> This skill is executed by the **local agent running on the developer's own machine**. All file reads/writes and command execution act directly on the **developer's local project directory**. Always use the local shell (local `bash`) and local file operations directly; no remote sandbox is involved, and there is no need to go through proxy tools such as `mira_local_*`.

## Initialization flow overview

**Emptiness check first → branch handling**:

- **Non-empty project** (Stage B): do not copy a template; directly **incrementally install the 3 packages** (AI Assistant / Unity MCP Extensions / PICO Unity SDK XR), skipping or upgrading based on existing dependency state.
- **Empty project** (Stage C → D): preferentially sparse-clone the corresponding template subdirectory (`PICOSpatial` / `PICOXR` / `OpenXR`) from `Pico-Developer/PICO-Unity-Project-Templates` (GitHub) into `$PROJECT_ROOT`; fall back to `pico-cli project create` on failure. Then modify `productName` / `ProjectVersion.txt`, and install the 3 packages.

**Shared wrap-up**: both branches finally open the project with `unity open ... --build-target Android`, letting Unity switch the Active Build Target to Android during startup (equivalent to the official Editor launch argument `-buildTarget Android`) — no need to switch manually after opening, and no dependency on MCP tools.

---

### Stage A — Read-only probing (do not ask the developer; run first)

Before popping up any form, complete the following read-only probing (shared by all branches):

1. **Emptiness check** (highest priority): check whether both `Assets/` directory **and** `Packages/manifest.json` are **missing at the same time**. Both missing → **empty project**; either present → **non-empty project**.
2. **Additional reads for non-empty projects**: read `m_EditorVersion` from `$PROJECT_ROOT/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` (used for the low-version gate in Stage B). Read `dependencies` from `$PROJECT_ROOT/Packages/manifest.json` (used in Stage B to determine the current versions of the 3 packages).
3. **Check installed editors** (only needed for empty projects): run `unity editors --installed` to split candidate Unity 6+ LTS versions into "installed / not installed" groups. **For non-empty projects, if Stage B does not change the version, you may skip this step to save time.**

---

## Stage B — Non-empty project branch (runs first; goes straight to incremental installation)

**If Stage A determines the project is non-empty, do not take the empty-project branch; execute B.1 → B.6 in order.**

### B.1 Low-version gate

- **Current version < Unity 6 (major version < 6000)**: ask "The current project's Unity version is `xxx`, which is below Unity 6. Upgrade?"
  - Choose "No" → **exit initialization immediately** (do not write config, do not continue).
  - Choose "Yes" → let the developer select a target Unity 6+ LTS version in the B.2 form.
- **Current version ≥ Unity 6**: ask "The current project's Unity version is `xxx`. Change the version?"
  - Choose "No" → keep the current version as `unity_version`; the B.2 form no longer shows the version selection item.
  - Choose "Yes" → the B.2 form requires selecting a target Unity 6+ LTS version.

### B.2 Minimal form collection (non-empty project)

A non-empty project already has an SDK choice (determined by existing dependencies; the `sdk` field is left blank or marked `existing`). The form **collects only necessary preferences**:

| Field           | Control       | Options                     | When shown                                     |
| --------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `unity_version` | Single-select | See "Version options" below | Only when B.1 chose "upgrade / change version" |
| `devices`       | Multi-select  | `pico swan`, `pico 4 ultra` | Always (**required, at least one**)            |
| `business_type` | Single-select | `Yes`, `No`                 | Always                                         |

> The values and mapping rules for `devices` and `business_type` are the same as in Stage C.

### B.3 Incrementally install the 3 packages (core logic)

Check the conditions below and write into the `dependencies` of `Packages/manifest.json`. **Preserve all of the developer's other existing dependencies; only make incremental additions/changes.**

> **Why init writes the manifest directly (bounded exception):** `AGENTS.md` and `pico-unity-package-manager` forbid hand-editing `Packages/manifest.json` and require every package change to go through the `pico_xr_package` MCP tool. Initialization is the explicit exception: the Unity Editor is not open yet and the MCP bridge is not running, so `pico_xr_package` is unavailable — and MCP Extensions (which backs that bridge) is itself one of the packages installed here. Direct manifest writes are therefore limited to this bootstrap step. Once init finishes and the Editor/MCP bridge is up, all subsequent package changes must go through `pico_xr_package`.

#### B.3.1 AI Assistant (`com.unity.ai.assistant`)

- **Not present** in `dependencies` → write `"com.unity.ai.assistant": "2.17.0-pre.1"`.
- **Present but version is not 2.17.0-pre.1** in `dependencies` → upgrade to `"2.17.0-pre.1"` (treated as "not on the latest").
- Already present and the version is already `2.17.0-pre.1` → **skip**.

#### B.3.2 Unity MCP Extensions (`com.bytedance.pico.mcp-extensions`)

- **Not present** in `dependencies` → write the following git dependency (SSH by default; if the developer has not configured an SSH key, switch to HTTPS — see the note in Stage D.4):
  ```json
  "com.bytedance.pico.mcp-extensions": "git@github.com:Pico-Developer/Unity-MCP-Extensions.git"
  ```
- Already present (pointing to that repo) → **skip** (keep the existing address and ref unchanged).

#### B.3.3 PICO Unity SDK (XR) three git dependencies

Check whether `com.bytedance.pico.xr` exists in `dependencies`:

- **Not present** → write the following **3 git dependencies together** into `dependencies`:
  ```json
  "com.bytedance.pico.spatialadapter": "https://github.com/Pico-Developer/PICO-Unity-SDK.git?path=/SpatialAdapter#main",
  "com.bytedance.pico.xr": "https://github.com/Pico-Developer/PICO-Unity-SDK.git?path=/XR#main",
  "com.plattar.unitygltf": "https://github.com/Pico-Developer/gltf-exporter.git?path=package/com.plattar.unitygltf#master"
  ```
- **Already present**, try to read the version from the `#ref` in the git URL or from the cached package's `package.json`:
  - Version **≥ 6.0.0** → **skip, do not update** (keep the developer's existing version, address, and ref).
  - Version **< 6.0.0** → ask the developer "The detected PICO Unity SDK (XR) version `xxx` is below 6.0.0. Upgrade to 6.0.0?"
    - Choose "No" → **exit the initialization flow immediately** (do not modify the manifest, do not write config).
    - Choose "Yes" → overwrite the corresponding keys with the 3 git dependencies above (write all 3 keys together, even if only `com.bytedance.pico.xr` was originally present).

> **Version-detection fallback**: when a git dependency (with `#ref` being a branch name such as `#main`) cannot yield a version number directly from the URL, try reading `version` from `Library/PackageCache/com.bytedance.pico.xr@*/package.json`; if there is no cache, treat it as "version cannot be determined" by default → the conservative approach is to **skip and not proactively upgrade**, only logging for the developer: "PICO SDK XR is present but its version is unknown; upgrade skipped. To force a refresh, manually change the `#ref`."

### B.4 Sync `ProjectVersion.txt` (only when B.1 chose to change the version)

If B.1 chose "upgrade / change version", set `m_EditorVersion` and `m_EditorVersionWithRevision` in `$PROJECT_ROOT/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` to the `unity_version` selected in B.2.

### B.5 Prepare the Unity version

Refer to [references/unity-versions.md](references/unity-versions.md):

- If `unity_version` comes from the "not installed" list → `unity install <unity_version> -m android` (bundle-installs Android Build Support; this takes a while — inform the developer before running).
- If it comes from the "installed" list or you keep the current version → `unity install-modules -e <unity_version> -m android` to confirm Android is installed (check the **Status** column in the output; skip if already installed).

### B.6 Write config.json and open the project (switch to Android on startup)

- Write `project_name`, `sdk` (for a non-empty project fill in `existing`, do not ask again), `unity_version`, `platform` (fixed `android`), `devices`, and `business_type` into `$PROJECT_ROOT/.pico-cli/config.json`. See the config structure in [references/config-schema.md](references/config-schema.md). If `.pico-cli/` does not exist, create it first.
- Run `unity projects add $PROJECT_ROOT`; then run:
  ```bash
  unity open $PROJECT_ROOT --build-target Android
  ```
  `--build-target Android` is passed directly to the Unity Editor (equivalent to the official Editor launch argument `-buildTarget Android`); Unity switches the Active Build Target to Android during startup — no need to switch manually afterward, and no dependency on any MCP tool.
- If the local `unity` wrapper does not recognize `--build-target`, use the equivalent form (pass the argument through to the Editor):
  ```bash
  unity open $PROJECT_ROOT -- -buildTarget Android
  ```
  or directly `.../Unity -projectPath $PROJECT_ROOT -buildTarget Android`.
- If Unity reports "requested build target is not supported / Android module missing" on startup → go back to B.5 and use `unity install-modules -e <unity_version> -m android` to install Android Build Support, then re-run the `unity open` above.

---

## Stage C — One-shot form collection for empty projects

**Only executed when Stage A determines the project is empty.** Merge into **a single form** collected all at once:

| Field           | Control       | Options                       | When shown                          |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `sdk`           | Single-select | `spatial`, `picoxr`, `openxr` | Always                              |
| `unity_version` | Single-select | See "Version options" below   | Always                              |
| `devices`       | Multi-select  | `pico swan`, `pico 4 ultra`   | Always (**required, at least one**) |
| `business_type` | Single-select | `Yes`, `No`                   | Always                              |

> **`devices` is required**: if the developer submits without selecting any device, prompt "Please select at least one target device" and require re-selection; only after validation passes may Stage D begin.
>
> **`business_type` value mapping**: the form question is "**Are you developing an enterprise edition?**" with options "Yes / No". **"Yes" → `business_type = toB`; "No" → `business_type = toC`**. Store the final mapped value when writing config.json.

**Version options (refer to [references/unity-versions.md](references/unity-versions.md)):** use the `unity editors --installed` results from Stage A to split into "installed / not installed" groups for display.

---

## Stage D — Batch execution after empty-project submit

### D.1 Pull the template into `$PROJECT_ROOT`

Based on the form's `sdk` selection, map the value to the **subdirectory name** in the upstream templates repo:

- `sdk = picoxr` → subdirectory `PICOXR`
- `sdk = openxr` → subdirectory `OpenXR`
- `sdk = spatial` → subdirectory `PICOSpatial`

**Preferred method (sparse clone, without git history)**: pull only the selected subdirectory's contents and lay them directly into `$PROJECT_ROOT`.

```bash
TEMPLATE_REPO="https://github.com/Pico-Developer/PICO-Unity-Project-Templates.git"
TEMPLATE_DIR="PICOXR"   # or "OpenXR" / "PICOSpatial", fill in per sdk selection

# Use a temp directory for sparse checkout, taking only the needed subdirectory
TMP_TPL="$(mktemp -d)"
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse "$TEMPLATE_REPO" "$TMP_TPL"
git -C "$TMP_TPL" sparse-checkout set "$TEMPLATE_DIR"

# Move the subdirectory contents (including hidden files) to $PROJECT_ROOT, then remove the temp dir.
# The template repo's Git metadata lives at "$TMP_TPL/.git" (the clone root), NOT inside
# "$TMP_TPL/$TEMPLATE_DIR/", so the glob below never moves any .git into $PROJECT_ROOT.
# We therefore only ever delete the validated temp directory and NEVER touch
# "$PROJECT_ROOT/.git" — any pre-existing project Git metadata is preserved.
shopt -s dotglob 2>/dev/null || true
mv "$TMP_TPL/$TEMPLATE_DIR/"* "$PROJECT_ROOT/"
rm -rf "$TMP_TPL"
```

- Upstream repo structure: three subfolders under the root, `PICOSpatial/`, `PICOXR/`, and `OpenXR/`, each an **independent, openable Unity project** (containing `Assets/`, `Packages/manifest.json`, `ProjectSettings/`, etc.), with the Unity Editor version unified at `6000.0.73f1`.
- This clone goes over GitHub HTTPS (443), following the network requirements of [Stage D.4](#d4-install-the-3-packages-ai-assistant--mcp-extensions--pico-sdk-xr); if the clone fails (no network / SSL issue / GitHub authentication blocked), immediately fall back to the **fallback method** below.

**Fallback method (used when the clone fails)**: call the `pico-cli` local template generator.

```bash
pico-cli project create --template <template> --name pico --package com.example.app
```

`<template>` is taken from the form's `sdk` value:

- `sdk = picoxr` → `--template picoxr`
- `sdk = openxr` → `--template openxr`
- `sdk = spatial` → `--template PICOSpatial`

Run in `$PROJECT_ROOT`. The command generates a complete Unity project structure (`Assets/`, `Packages/manifest.json`, `ProjectSettings/`, `UserSettings/`, etc.).

> ⚠️ If the `pico-cli` command is also not found, tell the developer to install/configure `pico-cli` first (outside the scope of this skill); if both methods fail, have the developer confirm network or CLI status and re-run this skill.

> 💡 Whether using the preferred method or the fallback, once the output lands in `$PROJECT_ROOT`, the subsequent D.2 uniformly updates `productName` and `ProjectVersion.txt`, and D.4 uniformly writes the 3 package dependencies — templates from both sources converge to the same state via the later stages.

### D.2 Template post-processing: fix productName and ProjectVersion

After the template is generated, make two overrides:

#### D.2.1 Modify `productName` in `ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset`

Change the value of the `productName` field to the **current project directory name** (i.e., `project_name` = basename of `$PROJECT_ROOT`).

`ProjectSettings.asset` is in Unity's YAML format; make a **precise line replacement** (only change the `productName:` line, do not touch other fields):

```bash
sed -i '' -E "s|^(  productName: ).*$|\\1${project_name}|" "$PROJECT_ROOT/ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset"
# For GNU sed (Linux), just drop the '' argument: sed -i -E "..."
```

If `project_name` contains spaces or special characters, escape as needed first to ensure the written YAML is valid.

#### D.2.2 Modify `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt`

Change `m_EditorVersion` and `m_EditorVersionWithRevision` to the `unity_version` selected in the form (same logic as Stage B.4). The template's default version may differ from the selected version and must be overwritten.

### D.3 Prepare the Unity version

Same as Stage B.5:

- Not installed → `unity install <unity_version> -m android`.
- Installed → `unity install-modules -e <unity_version> -m android` to add Android (skip if already installed).

### D.4 Install the 3 packages (AI Assistant / MCP Extensions / PICO SDK XR)

After the empty-project template is generated, `Packages/manifest.json` already exists. **Write the following 5 keys directly into `dependencies` (merging with the template's existing dependencies; do not overwrite other non-conflicting dependencies in the template)**:

> **Bounded exception (same as B.3):** writing these keys straight into the manifest is allowed only because the Unity Editor is not open yet and the `pico_xr_package` MCP tool is not available during init bootstrap. After initialization completes and the Editor/MCP bridge is running, all package changes must go through `pico_xr_package` — do not hand-edit the manifest post-init.

```json
"com.unity.ai.assistant": "2.17.0-pre.1",
"com.bytedance.pico.mcp-extensions": "git@github.com:Pico-Developer/Unity-MCP-Extensions.git",
"com.bytedance.pico.spatialadapter": "https://github.com/Pico-Developer/PICO-Unity-SDK.git?path=/SpatialAdapter#main",
"com.bytedance.pico.xr": "https://github.com/Pico-Developer/PICO-Unity-SDK.git?path=/XR#main",
"com.plattar.unitygltf": "https://github.com/Pico-Developer/gltf-exporter.git?path=package/com.plattar.unitygltf#master"
```

> **MCP Extensions address note**: SSH by default (`git@github.com:...`); if the developer has not configured a GitHub SSH key, or the local network blocks SSH port 22, switch to HTTPS:
>
> ```json
> "com.bytedance.pico.mcp-extensions": "https://github.com/Pico-Developer/Unity-MCP-Extensions.git"
> ```
>
> The common error `ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Operation timed out` = SSH 22 is blocked; handle in priority order:
>
> 1. Switch directly to the HTTPS dependency (recommended, uses port 443);
> 2. Route SSH over 443: add to `~/.ssh/config`
>    ```
>    Host github.com
>      Hostname ssh.github.com
>      Port 443
>      User git
>    ```
>    then verify with `ssh -T git@github.com`;
> 3. Use a proxy / switch to a company intranet mirror source.

> **Network prerequisite**: Unity will actually access `github.com` when resolving the 4 git dependencies above. If the developer's machine cannot access github.com or authentication fails (SSH `Permission denied (publickey)`, HTTPS `Authentication failed`, or `Could not resolve host`), this is a network/authentication issue, not a manifest-syntax issue. Tell the developer to handle it per the 3 items above; once network/authentication is restored, Unity re-resolves the dependencies with no need to change other steps.

### D.5 Write config.json

Write `project_name`, `sdk` (`spatial`, `picoxr`, or `openxr`), `unity_version`, `platform` (fixed `android`), `devices`, and `business_type` into `$PROJECT_ROOT/.pico-cli/config.json`. See the config structure in [references/config-schema.md](references/config-schema.md). If `.pico-cli/` does not exist, create it first (create only up to where `config.json` lives; do not create `downloads/`).

### D.6 Register and open the project (switch to Android on startup)

```
unity projects add /path/to/$PROJECT_ROOT
unity open /path/to/$PROJECT_ROOT --build-target Android
```

- First `unity projects add`: add the project to Unity's known-projects list.
- Then `unity open ... --build-target Android`: let the Unity Editor switch the Active Build Target to Android **during startup**. `--build-target Android` is essentially equivalent to Unity's official Editor launch argument `-buildTarget Android`; the platform switch is performed by Unity itself — no need to switch manually after startup, and no dependency on any MCP tool.
- If the local `unity` wrapper does not recognize `--build-target`, use the equivalent form (pass the argument through to the Editor):
  ```bash
  unity open /path/to/$PROJECT_ROOT -- -buildTarget Android
  ```
  or invoke the Editor binary directly: `.../Unity -projectPath /path/to/$PROJECT_ROOT -buildTarget Android`.

> **The platform must be Android** (PICO devices only support Android builds). If Unity reports "requested build target is not supported / Android module missing / Android Build Support not installed" on startup:
>
> - When installing a new version, use `unity install <unity_version> -m android` (bundle install).
> - For an existing version, use `unity install-modules -e <unity_version> -m android` to add it.
>
> After adding it, re-run `unity open ... --build-target Android`.

---

## After completion

Give the developer a brief report:

- Project type (empty project / non-empty project);
- For an empty project, the **template source**: "GitHub sparse-clone `PICOSpatial|PICOXR|OpenXR`" or "fallback `pico-cli project create --template ...`";
- Unity version (if `ProjectVersion.txt` was rewritten, note the adjustment from `xxx` to the selected version);
- Handling result of the 3 packages: AI Assistant (**newly installed / already present, skipped / upgraded to 2.17.0-pre.1**), MCP Extensions (**newly installed / already present, skipped**), PICO SDK XR (including gltf-exporter and SpatialAdapter, 3 git dependencies total) (**newly installed / ≥6.0.0 skipped / <6.0.0 upgrade-overwritten / version unknown, skipped**);
- Target platform: switched by Unity on startup via `unity open ... --build-target Android`, noting whether it was "switched to Android by the CLI argument this time / switched to Android after installing Android Build Support and reopening";
- Selected devices and business type (`toB` / `toC`);
- The path where `config.json` was written.
